Welcome to the **Tiny-OneM2M C API** repository! Dive into a world where the C programming language meets the OneM2M IoT platform. This isn't just any library; it's your gateway to seamless M2M communication.

## 🌐 What's Inside?

**Machine-to-machine (M2M)** and **Machine Type Communication (MTC)** are the unsung heroes of the IoT realm. They're the silent whispers allowing devices to chat, share secrets, and collaborate on grand tasks.

Enter **OneM2M** - the global standard that's like the United Nations for devices. It doesn't matter where your device comes from; OneM2M ensures they all speak the same language. And with **Tiny-OneM2M C API**, this conversation just got a lot more interesting.

### 🚗 Why Drive with C?

- 🚀 **Speed Demon**: Direct access to hardware resources? Check. Memory management? Check. C is the Usain Bolt of programming languages.
- 🎯 **Precision**: Perfect for environments where devices run on that one last sip of battery and have memory the size of a goldfish.
- 🤖 **Born for Embedded**: C's middle name is Embedded. It thrives in the nitty-gritty world of embedded systems.

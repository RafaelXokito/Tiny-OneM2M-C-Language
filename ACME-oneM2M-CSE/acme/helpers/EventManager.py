	A list of callable methods. Calling an instance of Event will cause a
	call to each function in the list in ascending order by index. 
	It supports all methods from its base class (list), so use append() and remove()
	to add and remove functions.

	An event is raised by calling the event: anEvent(anArgument). It may have an
	arbitrary number of arguments which are passed to the functions.

	The function will be called in a separate thread in order to prevent waiting
	for the returns. This might lead to some race conditions, so the synchronizations
	must be done inside the functions.

	Attention: 
		Since the parent class is a *list* calling *isInstance(obj, list)* will return True.

# Contributing

Whether reporting bugs, discussing improvements and new ideas or writing
extensions: Contributions to ACME are welcome! Here's how to get started:

1. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around
   a feature idea or a bug.
2. Fork the repository [https://github.com/ankraft/ACME-oneM2M-CSE](https://github.com/ankraft/ACME-oneM2M-CSE) on Github,
   create a new branch off the *master* branch and start making your changes
   (known as [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)).
3. Write a test which shows that the bug was fixed or that the feature works
   as expected.
4. Send a pull request and bug the maintainers until it gets merged and
   published.

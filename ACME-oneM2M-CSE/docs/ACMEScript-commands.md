<a name="commands_basic"></a>
## Basic

The following basic commands for running scripts in general are available.

<a name="command_assert"></a>
### ASSERT

Usage:  
ASSERT &lt;boolean expression>

The ASSERT command will terminate the script if its argument turns out to be false.

Example:
```text
assert [== [cse.type] IN]
```

<a name="command_break"></a>
### BREAK

Usage:  
BREAK &lt;result>\*

Break out of a [WHILE](#command_while) loop. The command may have an optional result argument that is returned as the result of the loop.

Example:
```text
while true
	...
	break aResult
	...
endwhile
```

Example using the [loop](ACMEScript-macros.md#macro_loop) macro.
```text
while [< [loop] 10]
	print [loop]
endwhile
```


<a name="command_case"></a>
### CASE

Usage:  
CASE &lt;match\*

This command starts a CASE block inside a [SWITCH](#command_switch) block. 
If present then the *match* argument will be compared against the argument of the surrounding SWITCH block.
If it matches then the code lines up to the next CASE or [ENDSWITCH](#command_endswitch) are executed.
If multiple CASE statements would match the comparison then only the first matching block is executed.

If the *match* argument is missing then the CASE block is executed when encountered and no previous
CASE statement did match before. It can be used as a default or catch-all block of a [SWITCH](#command_switch).
An empty CASE should always be the last CASE statement in a [SWITCH](#command_switch) block, 
because all the following CASE statements will be skipped.

The *match* argument can be a simplified regular expression for fuzzy comparisons. See the description of the
[match](ACMEScript-macros.md#macro_match) macro for a description of the supported operators and examples.


Example:

```text
switch [aVariable]
	case aValue
		...
	case anotherValue
		...
	case aR*x
		# e.g. matches aRegex
		...
	case
		# always matches
		...
endSwitch
```

There is second form of the CASE statement: When the SWITCH statement does not have a parameter then
CASE statements can have boolean expressions, or any procedure and macro, which, when those evaluate
to *true*, will have their code blocks executed. As with the other format only the first CASE that 
evaluates to *true* is executed.  
This can be used to replace otherwise overly complicated IF code sequences.

Example:

```text
switch
	case [< 4 3]
		print No
	case [> 4 3]
		print Yes
endswitch
```


<a name="command_continue"></a>
### CONTINUE

Usage:  
CONTINUE

Continue with the next iteration of a [WHILE](#command_while) loop.

Example:
```text
while true
	...
	continue
	...
endwhile
```


<a name="command_dec"></a>
### DEC

Usage:  
DEC &lt;variable> &lt;step>\*

This command decrements a numeric variable by the optional value `step`. The default is 1.

Example:
```text
set var 10
dec var
print [var]
# -> 9
```


<a name="command_else"></a>
### ELSE

Usage:  
ELSE

Start the ELSE part of an [IF](#command_if) block.

Example:
```text
if false
	...
else
	print This is the ELSE part
endif
```


<a name="command_endif"></a>
### ENDIF

Usage:  
ENDIF 

End an [IF](#command_if) or [ELSE](#command_else) block. 

Example:
```text
if true
	...
endif
```


<a name="command_endprocedure"></a>
### ENDPROCEDURE

Usage:  
ENDPROCEDURE &lt;result>\*

This command marks the end of a [PROCEDURE](#command_procedure). The command may have an optional result argument that is 
returned as the result of the procedure. The result is stored in the variable [result](ACMEScript-macros.md#macro_result).

Example:
```text
procedure aProcedure
	...
endProcedure aResult

aProcedure
print [result]
# -> aResult
```


<a name="command_endswitch"></a>
### ENDSWITCH

Usage:  
ENDSWITCH

This command marks the end of a [SWITCH](#command_switch) block.


Example:
```text
switch [variable]
	case aValue
		...
	case anotherValue
		...
	case
		...
endSwitch
```


<a name="command_endwhile"></a>
### ENDWHILE

Usage:  
ENDWHILE &lt;result>\*

End a [WHILE](#command_while) loop. The command may have an optional result argument that is returned as the result of the procedure.

Example:
```text
while [< [i] 10]
	...
endWhile aResult
```


<a name="command_expandmacros"></a>
### EXPANDMACROS

Usage:
EXPANDMACROS &lt;on|off>

Temporarily disable or enable macro and variable expansion for the following code execution.  
This is useful, for example, when using the [IMPORTRAW](#command_importraw) command and not escaping otherwise reserved characters, 
e.g. `[ ... ]`.

Example:
```text
expandMacros off
importraw
	...
expandMacros on
```


<a name="command_if"></a>
### IF

Usage:  
IF &lt;boolean expression>

Check comparison condition and begin a conditional IF block. An IF block may have an optional
[ELSE](#command_else) block that is executed instead in case the [comparison expression](ACMEScript.md#comp_op) 
turns out to be false.


Example:
```text
if [== [response.status] 200]
	...
else
	...
endif
```


<a name="command_inc"></a>
### INC

Usage:  
INC &lt;variable> &lt;step>\*

This command increments a numeric variable by the optional value `step`. The default is 1.

Example:
```text
set var 10
inc var
print [var]
# -> 11
```


<a name="command_log"></a>
### LOG

Usage:  
LOG &lt;message>

Print a message to the debug-level log.

Example:
```text
log Hello, World!
```


<a name="command_logerror"></a>
### LOGERROR

Usage:  
LOGERROR &lt;message>

Print a message to the error-level log.

Example:
```text
LOGERROR Danger, Will Robinson!
```


<a name="command_logdiv"></a>
### LOGDIVIDER

Usage:  
LOGDIVIDER [&lt;message>]

Print a line to the debug-level log. 

An optional message can be provided. That message is then centered on the line.

Example:
```text
LOGDIVIDER Something important follows
```

<a name="command_procedure"></a>
### PROCEDURE

Usage:  
PROCEDURE &lt;name>\*

This command defines a procedure. A procedure is a named sequence of commands that is executed in its own context. 
A procedure may have zero, one, or more arguments, which can be accessed via the [argc](ACMEScript-macros.md#macro_argc) and [argv](ACMEScript-macros.md#macro_argv)  macros. A procedure may also return a result, which is returned to the calling scope, 
see [ENDPROCEDURE](#command_endprocedure) for details.

One can regard a procedure as a script-local command definition.

Also, it is allowed to call other or the same procedure inside a procedure, however it is not allowed to define procedures inside procedures.

Example:
```text
# Define a procedure to double its argument
procedure double
	set x [* [argv 1] 2]
endProcedure [x]

# Call procedure
print [double 21]
```

Procedures may be called like normal commands as well. If they return a value then that is stored in the special 
variable *result*. Using the procedure defined in the previous example, one may call the procedure like
this:

```text
# Call procedure
double 21
print [result]
```

<a name="command_quit"></a>
### QUIT

Usage:  
QUIT &lt;result>\*

Terminate the running script successfully and return an optional result.

Example:
```text
quit aResult
```


<a name="command_quiterror"></a>
### QUITWITHERROR

Usage:  
QUITWITHERROR &lt;result>\*

Terminate the running script with an error and return an optional result.

Example:
```text
quitWithError aResult
```


<a name="command_run"></a>
### RUN

Usage:  
RUN &lt;script name> &lt;arguments>\*

Run another script. The first argument is the name of the script as set in the [name](ACMEScript.md#meta_name) 
[meta tag](ACMEScript.md#meta_tags) of that script. All other arguments are optional, and will be passed on as arguments to the called
script. The called script may return a result, which would then be available via the [result](#ACMEScript-macros.md#macro_result) variable.

Example:
```text
run anotherScript arg1 arg2
print [result]
```


<a name="command_set"></a>
### SET

Usage:   
SET &lt;variable> &lt;value>  
SET &lt;variable>

This command has two different formats:

- SET &lt;variable> &lt;value>  
Set the variable `variable` to the value `value`. The variable is created if it does not exist.
- SET &lt;variable>  
Deletes the variable `variable`.


Example:
```text
set a 21
set b 2
set c [* [a] [b]]
print [c]
# -> 42
set c
```


<a name="command_sleep"></a>
### SLEEP

Usage:  
SLEEP &lt;seconds>

Pause the script execution for `seconds` seconds.

Example:
```text
# sleep for 1.5 seconds
sleep 1.5
```


<a name="command_switch"></a>
### SWITCH

Usage:  
SWITCH &lt;argument>\*

Start a SWITCH block. The argument is then matched against individual [CASE](#command_case) statement. The code block of the first matching 
statement is executed. SWITCH blocks may be nested. A SWITCH block is closed by a [ENDSWITCH](#command_endswitch) command.

Example:
```text
switch [variable]
	case aValue
		...
	case anotherValue
		...
	case aR*x
		# e.g. matches aRegex
		...
	case
		# always matches
		...
endSwitch
```

The SWITCH statement may also not have a parameter. In this case the CASE statements can have
boolean expressions, or any procedure and macro, which, when those evaluate to *true*, will have 
their code blocks executed. As with the other format only the first CASE that evaluates to *true*
is executed.  
This can be used to replace otherwise overly complicated IF code sequences.

Example:

```text
switch
	case [< 4 3]
		print No
	case [> 4 3]
		print Yes
endswitch
```


<a name="command_while"></a>
### WHILE

Usage:  
WHILE &lt;boolean expression>

Start a WHILE loop. The loop is executed as long as the [comparison expression](ACMEScript.md#calc_comp) is true, or until the loop is 
left through a [BREAK](#command_break) command.

Example:
```text
set i = 0
while [< [i] 10]
	inc i
	...
endwhile
```

See also the special variable [loop](ACME-macros.md#macro_loop) for an automated loop variable. It can
be used to replace the variable in the example above:

Example:
```text
while [< [loop] 10]
	...
endwhile
```

`name:value`. The definition of headers are ended with an empty line or the [ENDHTTP](#command_endhttp)
command.

An optional body may be passed in the request after the empty line.

A http command is finished with the [ENDHTTP](#command_endhttp) command.

After the request is finished the response details are provided in the following variables. They are available
until the next http or CSE request.

- *response.status* - The http response status code.  
A status code of -1 means that a connection to the given *URL* was not possible.
- *response.body* - If the response contains a body then this variable contains this body as
text, otherwise the variable is undefined.
- *response.&lt;header>* - All the response's headers are defined as separate variables, e.g. the 
http *Date* header is stored in the variable *response.Date*.  
Please note that variable names are case-insensitive.
